```

### Integration Points

- **Parser Models**: Direct integration with `app/services/parsers/` model definitions for header detection and validation rules
- **Model Headers**: Uses `app/services/utilities/model-headers.js` for accurate column mapping and field validation
- **Prohibited Items Database**: References `app/services/data/data-prohibited-items.json` for compliance checking
- **MCP Excel Server**: Leverages MCP Excel tools for direct file manipulation without script generation
- **Business Rule Engine**: Applies DEFRA trade export regulations and validation patterns

## Features & Capabilities

### Comprehensive Excel Validation

- **Row-by-Row Error Analysis**: Detailed validation of individual data rows with specific error reporting and column references
- **Prohibited Items Detection**: Cross-references country of origin, commodity codes, and treatment types against regulatory database
- **Business Rule Compliance**: Validates REMOS patterns, NIRMS values, and mandatory field completeness
- **Error Pattern Recognition**: Detects Excel error values (#N/A, #REF!, etc.), data type mismatches, and formatting issues

### Bulk File Processing

- **Universal File Discovery**: Comprehensive scanning and cataloging of all Excel files in specified directories
- **Surgical Column Operations**: Precise addition or updating of specific columns while preserving all existing data
- **Data Table Boundary Detection**: Intelligent identification of data ranges, excluding header rows and totals sections
- **Header and Totals Protection**: Ensures no modifications to existing column headers or aggregation rows
- **100% Processing Coverage**: Guarantees every discovered file is attempted with complete accountability reporting

### Enterprise-Grade Quality Assurance

- **Zero Code Generation**: Direct Excel operations through MCP tools without script generation or programming solutions
- **Complete Data Integrity**: Maintains existing data structures, formulas, and formatting throughout processing
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Graceful handling of corrupted files, access issues, and complex layouts
- **Detailed Progress Reporting**: Real-time processing updates with file-by-file outcome documentation
- **Validation Criteria Compliance**: Extensive quality gates ensuring accurate and reliable operations

## Technical Implementation

### Core Configuration

The Excel Tools are implemented as GitHub Copilot prompts with specific tool configurations:

- **Excel Validator**: Uses `tools: ['excel', 'sequential-thinking']` for comprehensive file analysis and validation reporting
- **Bulk Column Updater**: Uses `tools: ['mcp_excel_*', 'list_dir', 'file_search']` for direct Excel file manipulation
- **Model Integration**: References parser model definitions from `app/services/utilities/model-headers.js`
- **Claude 4 Sonnet Optimization**: Both prompts are optimized for enhanced Excel processing capabilities

### Validation Framework

The validation system uses a layered approach:

```yaml
PLP Model-Based Strategy:
├── Parser Model Loading → Extract specific model configuration
├── Header Detection → Use model regex patterns for column identification  
├── Field Validation → Apply model-specific validation rules
├── Business Rules → REMOS patterns, NIRMS values, prohibited items
└── Error Reporting → Row-by-row detailed error descriptions
```

### Processing Architecture

Bulk operations follow a systematic workflow:

```yaml
Processing Pipeline:
├── File Discovery → Comprehensive folder scanning and cataloging
├── Structure Analysis → Data table detection and boundary identification
├── Surgical Updates → Precise column operations within data boundaries
├── Integrity Validation → Verification of header and totals preservation
└── Comprehensive Reporting → Complete accountability for all operations
```

## Usage Guidelines

### Getting Started

1. **Select Appropriate Tool**: Choose Excel Validator for validation or Bulk Column Updater for processing
2. **Prepare Input Parameters**: Gather file paths, parser models, and processing specifications
3. **Execute with Developer Mode**: Use Developer chat mode for optimal context and tool integration
4. **Review Results**: Validate outputs and address any reported errors or issues

### Best Practices

#### Excel Validation Workflow

- **Focused Validation**: Use failure reason parameter to target specific error conditions rather than comprehensive audits
- **Model Selection**: Choose correct parser model (coop-1, tesco-1, etc.) based on file source and format
- **Error Prioritization**: Address critical errors (prohibited items, invalid REMOS) before minor formatting issues
- **Iterative Validation**: Re-validate files after making corrections to ensure error resolution

#### Bulk Processing Workflow

- **Pre-Processing Backup**: Ensure file backups exist before bulk operations (tools modify files directly)
- **Small Batch Testing**: Test column updates on small file sets before processing large batches
- **Progress Monitoring**: Review real-time progress reports to identify and address issues early
- **Result Verification**: Validate that all discovered files appear in final processing reports

### Common Workflows

#### Excel Processing Sequence
```
1. Validate file structure using "excel-validator"
2. Apply bulk updates using "excel-bulk-column-updater"  
3. Re-validate after changes to confirm error resolution
4. Generate parser if needed using parser templates
5. Create comprehensive test suite for new configurations
```

#### Quality Assurance Workflow
```
1. Run comprehensive validation with specific parser model
2. Review error reports and prioritize critical issues
3. Apply bulk corrections where applicable
4. Validate prohibited items against regulatory database
5. Confirm compliance with DEFRA trade export requirements
```
