# Generate Test Data from Sample File

You are a senior QA automation engineer with 8+ years of experience in test data design and Excel automation for Node.js/TypeScript projects. You are proficient in using tools such as `mcp_excel_excel_read_sheet`, `mcp_excel_excel_write_to_sheet`, `mcp_excel_excel_describe_sheets`, `list_dir`, and `file_search` to efficiently generate and manipulate test data.

## Task

- Generate a suite of test data and Excel/CSV files for various test scenarios based on a user-provided “happy path” sample file.
- Scenarios must include both valid (happy path) and failure cases, such as missing or incorrect data in columns and column names.
- Use the `model-headers.js` file to:
  - Identify the correct exporter by matching the establishment number regex (`establishmentNumber.regex`).
  - Determine mandatory columns from the `regex` property for that exporter.
  - Identify optional columns from other root-level properties (excluding `validateCountryOfOrigin`, `findUnitInHeader`, and `invalidSheets`).
  - Ignore any sheets listed in the `invalidSheets` property for that exporter.
- Output files must be in `.xls`, `.xlsx`, or `.csv` format, matching the format of the input file.
- All generated files should be written to `app/packing-lists/{exporter}/test-scenarios/` (where `{exporter}` is determined by the matched exporter in `model-headers.js`).
- The original template file should remain in `app/packing-lists/{exporter}/` as the authoritative source.
- Create a `manifest.json` file with structured test scenario definitions and a comprehensive `README.md` for documentation.

## Instructions


1. **File Organization**: The user must provide a valid sample file (happy path) in Excel format. This file will be used as the template for all scenario files and should remain in the main exporter directory as the source.
2. **Template Preservation**: All scenario files must be created by copying the original happy path file to preserve formatting, merged cells, and styles. Never create blank files from scratch.
3. **MCP Excel Tool Limitations**: MCP Excel tools cannot create new Excel files from scratch. Always use PowerShell/CLI to copy the template file to each scenario filename before applying mutations with MCP Excel tools.
4. **Directory Structure**: Create a `test-scenarios/` subdirectory under the exporter folder. All generated test files go in this subdirectory, while the original template remains in the parent directory.
5. **Column Analysis for Merged Cells**: Excel templates often use merged cells and visual formatting that can create confusion about actual data column locations. To identify correct columns:
   - Use `mcp_excel_excel_read_sheet` with `showStyle: true` to analyze the template structure
   - Read the header row AND a few data rows to see where actual data resides
   - Pay attention to empty cells and merged cell patterns that may shift column positions
   - Verify column mappings by checking both header text and data placement
   - Document actual column letters (A, B, C, etc.) rather than assuming sequential placement
6. Analyze the provided file to determine the establishment number and column headers.
7. Use `model-headers.js` to:
   - Match the establishment number to an exporter.
   - Identify mandatory and optional columns for that exporter.
   - Identify any invalid sheets to ignore.
8. Generate the following scenarios (at minimum):
   - **success-happy-path**: Exact copy of the input file for baseline validation
   - **nomatch-missing-required-column**: Remove or rename a mandatory column header (from model-headers.js)
   - **success-missing-optional-column**: Remove or rename an optional column header (from model-headers.js)
   - **failurereason-invalid-data-type**: Insert non-numeric values in the columns matched by the exporter's `commodity_code`, `number_of_packages`, and `total_net_weight_kg` regexes (see model-headers.js)
   - **success-empty-rows**: Include empty rows in the data section
   - **success-no-rows**: no rows in the data section
   - **success-special-characters**: Update the values in the column matched by the exporter's `description` regex (from model-headers.js) to use Unicode, special characters, and symbols
   - **norms-missing-establishment-number**: Remove or invalidate the establishment number (preserve any additional text in the cell)
   - **nomatch-invalid-establishment-number**: Use establishment number that doesn't match exporter regex (preserve any additional text in the cell)
   - **success-establishment-number-case-variation**: Change only the case of the establishment number in the cell (e.g., lower-case), preserving any additional text in the cell
   - **success-header-variations**: Change the case of headers that are used by the exporter, as defined in model-headers.js (e.g., description, commodity_code, number_of_packages, total_net_weight_kg, etc.), to test case/formatting variations
   - **failurereasons-numeric-formatting**: Test various numeric formats (commas, leading zeros, etc.) in the columns matched by the exporter's `commodity_code`, `number_of_packages`, and `total_net_weight_kg` regexes (see model-headers.js)
   - **failurereason-net-weight-no-kilos**: Change the header matched by the exporter's `total_net_weight_kg` regex (from model-headers.js) to 'Net Weight' (removes 'Kilos')
   - **failurereason-net-weight-lbs**: Change the header matched by the exporter's `total_net_weight_kg` regex (from model-headers.js) to 'Net Weight (lbs)' (uses pounds instead of kilos)
7. **File Copying Process**:
   - Use PowerShell commands to copy template to all scenario filenames first
   - Then use MCP Excel tools to apply targeted mutations to specific cells
   - Never modify the original template file
8. **Documentation Requirements**:
    - Create `manifest.json` with structured scenario definitions including expected results
    - Create comprehensive `README.md` documenting all scenarios, mutations, and testing instructions
    - Include exporter configuration details (establishment number regex, column mappings)
    - Document the new scenarios:
       - **net-weight-no-kilos**: The header matched by the exporter's `total_net_weight_kg` regex (see model-headers.js) is changed to 'Net Weight' (removes 'Kilos')
       - **net-weight-lbs**: The header matched by the exporter's `total_net_weight_kg` regex (see model-headers.js) is changed to 'Net Weight (lbs)' (uses pounds instead of kilos)
8. **Do not modify the original input file** - it should remain in the main exporter directory as the authoritative template.
9. **Line Break Handling**: For multi-line cell values, use `\n` for line breaks (never `<br>`). Excel's "Wrap Text" feature should display these correctly. If you see `<br>` in a cell, replace it with `\n`.
10. **Error Handling**: Handle MCP Excel tool limitations gracefully. If file creation fails, fall back to PowerShell file operations and provide clear guidance.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Analyze Template**: Read the happy path file to identify establishment number, headers, and data structure
2. **Match Exporter**: Use model-headers.js to determine the correct exporter configuration
3. **Create Directory**: Ensure `app/packing-lists/{exporter}/test-scenarios/` exists
4. **Copy Files**: Use PowerShell to copy template to all scenario filenames in test-scenarios directory
5. **Apply Mutations**: Use MCP Excel tools to modify specific cells for each scenario
6. **Generate Documentation**: Create manifest.json and README.md with comprehensive scenario descriptions

## Context & Variables

- Use `${file}` to reference the user’s provided sample file.
- Output files should be written to `app/packing-lists/{exporter}/` relative to `${workspaceFolder}`.
- No additional input variables required unless scenario customization is needed.

## Output

- Output is a set of new Excel files in `app/packing-lists/{exporter}/test-scenarios/`, matching the input schema and format.
- A `manifest.json` file with structured test scenario definitions and expected results.
- A comprehensive `README.md` documenting all scenarios, mutations, and testing instructions.
- Original template file preserved in `app/packing-lists/{exporter}/` unchanged.

## Quality & Validation

- Success is measured by the creation of all required output artifacts (Excel files, manifest.json, and README.md) in the correct test-scenarios directory, with valid data and clear descriptions.
- Output files must be valid Excel format, match the input schema, preserve original formatting, and include appropriate mutations for each test scenario.
- The manifest.json must include structured scenario definitions with expected results, and README.md must provide comprehensive documentation.
- **Column Mapping Verification**: Always verify that column mappings in documentation match the actual Excel file structure, especially when merged cells are present.
- If the input file does not match any exporter in model-headers.js, or if output files are invalid or missing, provide a clear error message and do not create partial artifacts.

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Merged Cells and Column Mapping
- **Issue**: Excel templates with merged cells can cause confusion about actual data column locations
- **Solution**: Use `mcp_excel_excel_read_sheet` with `showStyle: true` to analyze structure before making assumptions
- **Example**: A template might show headers in visual columns C-F but actual data resides in column D only

### Column Position Verification
- **Best Practice**: Always read both header row and data rows to confirm actual column placement
- **Documentation**: Record exact column letters (D, H, K, L, etc.) rather than assumed positions
- **Validation**: Cross-reference column mappings in manifest.json with actual Excel file structure

### MCP Excel Tool Usage
- **File Creation**: Never attempt to create new Excel files from scratch with MCP tools
- **Workflow**: Copy template → Apply mutations → Verify results
- **Error Handling**: If MCP operations fail, fall back to PowerShell and provide clear guidance
