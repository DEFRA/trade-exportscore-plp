# Giovanni 1 Country of Origin Validation Specification (AB#591527)

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** September 22, 2025  
**Status:** Draft  
**Related Work Items:** AB#591527  
**Dependencies:** AB#592259 (Country of Origin Validation Rules - MVP)

## Overview

This specification defines the implementation requirements for Country of Origin (CoO) validation for Giovanni 1 trader packing lists within the DEFRA trade-exportscore-plp service. The validation ensures NIRMS compliance through variable blanket statement validation and prohibited item checking for Giovanni 1-specific Excel format with treatment type header validation.

## Business Context

### User Story

**As a** caseworker  
**I want** the Packing List Parser to help me validate Country of Origin (CoO) entries on Giovanni 1 packing lists  
**So that** I can make informed decisions about accepting or rejecting General Certificate (GC) applications in line with NIRMS requirements

### Scope

- Collect relevant CoO fields from Giovanni 1 trader format using blanket statement detection
- Provide comprehensive validation for Country of Origin compliance with NIRMS requirements
- Enforce blanket NIRMS statement validation rules with treatment type header validation
- Check against prohibited items list with treatment type considerations
- Generate comprehensive error messages with location details and aggregated reporting

## Giovanni 1 Trader Format Specification

### Column Mapping

The Giovanni 1 packing list uses the following column structure:

- **Column C:** 'DESCRIPTION' - Product description for items
- **Column E:** 'Commodity Code' - European Union commodity classification code
- **Column F:** 'Country of Origin' - Country of origin designation for each product
- **Column G:** 'Quantity' - Package quantity information
- **Column H:** 'Net Weight (KG)' - Net weight in kilograms

### NIRMS Value Mapping

**Giovanni 1 uses variable blanket statement validation:**

**NIRMS Statement Location:** Cell A:I50  
**NIRMS Statement Value:** 'The exporter of the products covered by this document (NIRMS RMS-GB-000153) declares that these products are intend for the Green lane and will remain in Northern Ireland.'  
**Treatment Blanket Location:** Cell H:I17
