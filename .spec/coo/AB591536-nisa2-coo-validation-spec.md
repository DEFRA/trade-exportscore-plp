# Nisa 2 Country of Origin Validation Specification (AB#591536)

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Status:** Draft  
**Related Work Items:** AB#591536  
**Dependencies:** AB#592259 (Country of Origin Validation Rules - MVP)

## Overview

This specification defines the implementation requirements for Country of Origin (CoO) validation for Nisa 2 trader packing lists within the DEFRA trade-exportscore-plp service. The validation ensures NIRMS compliance and prohibited item checking for Nisa 2-specific Excel format.

## Business Context

### User Story

**As a** caseworker  
**I want** the Packing List Parser to help me validate Country of Origin (CoO) entries on Nisa 2 packing lists  
**So that** I can make informed decisions about accepting or rejecting General Certificate (GC) applications in line with NIRMS requirements

### Scope

- Collect CoO-relevant fields from Nisa 2 format
- Apply NIRMS + CoO validation via existing generic utilities
- Enforce prohibited items cross-reference rules
- Provide standardised failure reasons with sheet/row location
- Remain configuration-driven (no bespoke validator logic)

## Nisa 2 Trader Format Specification

### Column Mapping

The Nisa 2 packing list uses the following column structure:

- **Column F:** 'TARIFF CODE EU' - Commodity Code for product classification
- **Column M:** 'COUNTRY OF ORIGIN' - Country of Origin information
- **Column O:** 'NIRMS' - NIRMS classification (row-level)
- **Column Q:** 'TYPE OF TREATMENT' - Treatment Type specification

### NIRMS Value Mapping

**Nisa 2 follows the standard NIRMS values as defined in AB#592259:**

**True Values (NIRMS = Yes, case insensitive):**

- Yes | NIRMS | Green | Y | G

**False Values (NIRMS = No, case insensitive):**

- No | Non-NIRMS | Non NIRMS | Red | N | R

## Acceptance Criteria
